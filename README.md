# Hybrid Proxy Demo (RSA + PQC Simulation)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **hybrid proxy concept** where messages can be encrypted using either:
- Classical RSA encryption, or
- A simulated PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) mode.

## Features
- Local server-client communication using sockets.
- Switchable encryption modes (`RSA` or simulated `PQC`).
- Crypto-agile design â€” supports algorithm upgrade with minimal disruption.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/hybrid-proxy-demo.git
   cd hybrid-proxy-demo
```
